# Information-Network
Python Programs to generate information networks with big data
The Data for this program can be found from: http://projects.csail.mit.edu/dnd/DBLP/

The program first generate the unweighted 2005, 2006 and weighted 2005 author networks. 

Using their Nodes and Edges, I generate some basic link analysis and prediction about the 2006 authorship using networkx.
